## Add Tag Then Color Then Notes Procedure

1. Add exactly one `gogh/<domain>` tag to frontmatter.
2. Add exactly one `note/<type>` tag that matches the `type` field.
3. Confirm `assets/template-brain/.obsidian/graph.json` has the matching tag query and color.
4. Add or update notes only after the tag and graph color are in place.
5. Run the vault linter after editing the note set.
