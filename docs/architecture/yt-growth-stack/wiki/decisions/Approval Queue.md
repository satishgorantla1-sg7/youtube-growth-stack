# Approval Queue

No action is approved until it has source, confidence, owner, status, and rollback.

## What it is

The approval queue is the control point for decisions that may change vault outputs or operator behavior.

## How it works

Add proposed changes here before applying them to release-affecting notes, reports, or workflows.

## Best practice

- Require an owner before approval. PRACTITIONER
- Require a dated source before approval. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Record rollback before implementation. PRACTITIONER

## Pitfalls

- Do not treat an empty rollback as an approved rollback.
- Do not approve mutation decisions from unsupported claims.
- Do not skip this queue for release-affecting workflow changes.

## Queue

| Action | Source | Confidence | Owner | Status | Rollback |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Confirm first source pack | [[Source Manifest Guide]] | practitioner | YT Growth Stack Team | proposed | Leave scaffold notes unchanged |
