# Research Refresh Workflow

The research refresh workflow keeps fast-moving skill guidance tied to dated sources.

## What it is

Refresh cadence: on-changelog for github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill and tasteskill.dev/changelog; monthly for the SKILL.md rules and the three dials; quarterly for ecosystem coverage (Emil Kowalski, Developers Digest, skill directories) and the Anthropic Agent Skills / SKILL.md format.

## How it works

1. Start with official, primary, vendor, regulator, standards-body, or API docs.
2. Record URL, retrieval date, version, deprecation/sunset notes, and confidence.
3. Update `references/current-requirements.md`.
4. Only then update domain-specific recommendations.

## Best practice

- Prefer official and primary sources first. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Record retrieval dates with every source. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Mark contested claims instead of flattening conflicts. PRACTITIONER

## Pitfalls

- Do not treat social summaries as primary evidence.
- Do not refresh recommendations without recording source provenance.
- Do not hide upstream conflict between the six skills.

## Sources

- [[Source Manifest Guide]]
