# Source Intake Workflow

The source intake workflow preserves raw evidence before any synthesized advice changes.

## What it is

This flow is the path from raw source material to a linked source note.

## How it works

1. Store raw source under `.raw/sources/`.
2. Record source path, hash, owner, and retrieval date.
3. Create a note under `wiki/sources/`.
4. Link affected entities and deliverables.

## Best practice

- Store raw material before summarizing it. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Record sha256 hashes for raw files. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Link source notes back to affected deliverables. PRACTITIONER

## Pitfalls

- Do not mutate `.raw/` source material after ingest.
- Do not ingest credentials or private secrets.
- Do not cite source notes that do not point to raw evidence.

## Sources

- [[Source Manifest Guide]]

## Next actions
