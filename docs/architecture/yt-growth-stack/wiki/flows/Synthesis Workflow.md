# Synthesis Workflow

The synthesis workflow turns source notes into cited deliverables without inventing claims.

## What it is

This flow separates evidence, interpretation, recommendations, and rollback paths.

## How it works

1. Read source notes and `.raw/.manifest.json`.
2. Separate facts, interpretation, and recommendations.
3. Add confidence and failure path to recommendations.
4. Link recommendations to [[Approval Queue]] and [[Action Roadmap]].

## Best practice

- Separate facts from recommendations. EVIDENCE-BASED
- Link recommendations to approval status. PRACTITIONER
- Keep generated deliverables reproducible. PRACTITIONER

## Pitfalls

- Do not promote scaffold prose into source-backed claims.
- Do not write recommendations without confidence and rollback.
- Do not overwrite demo vault files by hand.

## Sources

- [[Source Manifest Guide]]

## Related

- [[Source Intake Workflow]] provides raw evidence.
- [[Health Scorecard]] reports current readiness.
- [[Best Practices Kernel]] defines review rules.
- [[Approval Queue]] controls decisions.
- [[Action Roadmap]] receives next actions.
- [[CONVENTIONS]] defines flow fields.
- [[Tag Taxonomy]] defines ops tagging.
- [[Index]] keeps the flow discoverable.

## Next actions

- Run synthesis after source intake and before report rendering.
